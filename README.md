# Overview
This is a boilerplate repo for express apps backed by MongoDB and was built using the steps provided in [Writing a CRUD app with Node.js and MongoDB](https://codeburst.io/writing-a-crud-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-e0827cbbdafb).

It provides boilerplate API methods to create, read, update and delete models from an API and store them in MongoDB.

MongoDB is run in a docker container and mounted to the local file system for easy persistence. This example uses MongoDB 3.6.
